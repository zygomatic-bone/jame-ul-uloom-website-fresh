* Files are copied byte-for-byte (so they stay provably authentic). The only change made is that CMYK JPEGs, which some
  browsers and phones render with wrong colours, are converted to RGB.
* Destination names are lower-case (the host is case sensitive). Identical pictures that the old site copied into
